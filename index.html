  <p>I am a double major in Visual Communication Design and Marketing at Eastern Washignton University. I have a love for both design and business. I love to utilize my passion for design and business in day to day occurrences. I found that design and marketing go very well together, as they tend to feed off of eachother in a unique and beautiful way. Growing up, I always thought I would pursue a career soley in business as both of my parents went to school for business and many family members of mine also either run their own business or are business-minded. As years went by, I noticed that in any down time I had, I was creating in any way I could and that in most areas of my life I was doing things in a way that was creative. With that in mind, I decided to also pursue design as a career.</p>
