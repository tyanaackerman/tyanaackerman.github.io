      <section class="bio">
        <p>Currently, I am a student at Eastern Washington University (EWU). I am pursuing two degrees in Visual Communication Design and Marketing, as I have a love for both design and business. Utilizing my passion for design and business ocurrs on a day-to-day basis as I am constantly seeking new ways and opportunities to grow. Growing up, I always thought I would pursue a career soley in business as both of my parents went to school for business and many family members of mine also either run their own business or are business-minded. As years went by, I noticed that in any down time I had, I was creating in any way I could and that in most areas of my life I was doing things in a way that was creative. With that in mind, I decided to also pursue design as a career. My hope is to combine my passion of design and business in order to make a difference in this world. One of my favorite sayings of mine is the following:</p>
